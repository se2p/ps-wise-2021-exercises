# - The larger problem is decomposed into 'things' that make sense for
#   the problem domain
#
# - Each 'thing' is a capsule of data that exposes one single procedure,
#   namely the ability to receive and dispatch messages that are sent to
#   it
#
# - Message dispatch can result in sending the message to another capsule
