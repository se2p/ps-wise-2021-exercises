# Exercise 05

Use Introspection and Reflection to measure code coverage of your implementation of the "Word Index" program in the Things style.

Develop a program called `coverage.py` that 

1. takes as input the python script `word-index.py` and all its arguments

2. prints a coverage report on the console after the execution of the `word-index.py` program terminates.


Basic coverage metrics are:

  - Method coverage.
  - Branch coverage.
  - Statement coverage.

Try to compute as many coverage metrics as possible.

> You might perform some basic adjustments of "Word Index" to simplify the coverage
computation, but you cannot fundamentally change your program to make it easier to compute the coverage metrics !
